Problems:
- Existing authentication processes are centralized: Impossible to combine anonimity with identity.
 - If Service B wants to know some detail provided by Service A, this means that Service A  knows that User 1 uses Service B.
- If Service B wants to know some detail of User 1 from Service A, they request data from Service A directly.
- Hard for user to know what data is actually exchanged between parties.
- Service A now knows about User 1 using Service B.

Solutions:
- Put the user in _full_ control over what data is shared.
 - User decides what, when and how to share data.
- You pay for what you use:
  - Users pay a tiny fee:
   - when creating a new identity.
   - when storing an Authentication or Verification Token to allow cross-device access.
  - Services pay a tiny fee:
   - to create a Revocation Certificate that can be used to retract a Verification Token at a later time.
  - REST IS FREE!!!
